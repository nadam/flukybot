Flukybot
============

Yes, you can run a Telegram bot locally in your own browser using JavaScript. No need to install anything since you already have a browser. You're not likely to have your browser online all the time though, so the bot might be a bit fluky. This is mainly a proof-of-concept and a way to experiment with the Bot API with JavaScript.

You can try it out at <a href="http://anyro.se/flukybot/">anyro.se/flukybot/</a> or download the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nadam/flukybot/gh-pages/index.html">index.html</a> file and open it locally.
